              Positive Reset Services is a behavioral care franchise that has developed a
              telemedicine system that transforms and simplifies mental health services. Our network
              of physicians supporting this unique Behavioral Care model is at the center of its
              success. The presence of doctors every hour when the clinic is open allows patients to
              receive services. This is a great competitive advantage given that by normal industry
              standards, it takes a long time to see a doctor. This is a new and secure business
              model that allows clinics to operate, franchisees to run their business, hire
              employees and take care of patients.

            This allows an investor with no experience in the behavioral field to scale their
            business in the industry. If you combine the fact that mental health care is recession
            resistant with our advanced telemedicine software, you have a recipe for success with or
            without a pandemic, of course.

              Thanks to telehealth and the need for mental health services, franchisees can depend
              on a successful business model that performs well during even the most challenging
              economic circumstances. The path to success is very straightforward to understand. Not
              only is it a business model that’s going to work for a year or two, it’s a concept
              that you can easily see working for the length of the franchise agreement.
