              The franchise has, hopefully, already done the work of building a brand and patients
              trust. That means you’re more likely to have customers as soon as you open, and you
              can even leverage on existing knowledge of the brand to build excitement for the
              opening beforehand. Your business is backed by the overall franchise, which means you
              have more leeway for growing pains than you might with a stand-alone small business.
