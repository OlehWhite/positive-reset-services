            content="A NEW NORMAL MEANS NEW OPPORTUNITIES
Positive Reset Services is a behavioral care franchise that has developed a telemedicine system that transforms and simplifies mental health services. Our network of physicians supporting this unique Behavioral Care model is at the center of its success. The presence of doctors every hour when the clinic is open allows patients to receive services. This is a great competitive advantage given that by normal industry standards, it takes a long time to see a doctor. This is a new and secure business model that allows clinics to operate, franchisees to run their business, hire employees and take care of patients. All franchisees have access to a proprietary telemedicine software system. Telemedicine immediately resonated with existing and potential franchisees, which they proclaim as an innovative business model that will be attractive to future investors trying to see what business opportunities will be viable in our current economic climate.

This allows an investor with no experience in the behavioral field to scale their business in the industry. If you combine the fact that mental health care is recession resistant with our advanced telemedicine software, you have a recipe for success with or without a pandemic, of course."

Entrusting franchise owners to represent a brand is a significant risk. Most franchises provide training programs to ensure all those representing the brand are aligned with the franchisor. Franchisees attend an initial training program and often have ongoing training to keep everyone on the same page. This guidance also keeps the team abreast of changes as the system evolves."

It contains all the aspects of the business the owners need to learn to operate the franchise. Like a school syllabus outlines a course, the manual serves a similar purpose. Every business has its unique styles, including dialect, recipes, uniforms, how to greet customers, etc. Traditionally, the operations manual includes the franchise goals, daily procedures, accounting, customer service, personnel topics and training employees. The information included in the manual is confidential. Often, franchisees are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement before beginning this phase. The franchisor also outlines specific performance expectations and instructions on how to provide sales reports, etc."

It’s also a time to see how to operate the machinery and/or make recipes for the first time.

Training at headquarters can last a few days to one week. This is the time franchise owners need to grasp each concept to operate their business. In many cases, franchise owners are encouraged to bring along a manager or employee who will train other staff members on-site."

When they get to this phase, they hire and train staff for specific roles such as cashiers, customer service, and office positions. Often times, a franchise mentor from the corporate office is assigned to new franchisees. This representative can assist with the grand opening of the new franchise."

Continuous training is essential to keeping franchisees informed about insider tips, new products or services, and future advertising and marketing campaigns."
